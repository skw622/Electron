First you have to download the syncthing app for your OS.
Next run the syncthing app and then will be open the browser for the app.
Here you can get the API Key in setting GUI.
-----------------------------xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-----------------------
At a first we have to run the "npm install" command in terminal(of course in source code path) to install node modules.
And you can run "npm run start" command to run the script.
And also you can run "npm run package-mac" command to build app for mac OS version.
If you run this command "npm run package-win", then will be built app for windows version. 

After run the electron app you can paste the API key and input rest api url,
and next pressing the fetch data button, you can get the result.
